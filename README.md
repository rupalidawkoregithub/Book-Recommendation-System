# Book-Recommendation-System
This repository contains the code and documentation for a book recommendation system using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal of this project is to recommend books to users based on their reading history and preferences.
There are 2 main types of personalized recommendation systems:

## Content based filtering
Recommendations are based on user's past likes/ dislikes & item feature space. The system makes recommendations which are similar to items the user has liked in the past. Items are considered similar based on item's features such as author, publisher, genre etc.

## Collaborative based filtering
Recommendations are based solely on user's past likes/ dislikes & how other users have rated other items. The system does not take into consideration an item's features like author, publisher, genre etc nor a user's features like age, gender, location etc. These take either a memory based approach or a model based approach.
